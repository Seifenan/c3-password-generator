# JavaScript-C3: Password Generator

An **average Password** can be **guessed** by the average user or be vulnerable to **brute-force** attacks. 

Using a **combination** of **random** uppercase and lowercase alphabets, as well as, numbers and special characters in your **Password**, increases its **strength** and **prevents** malicious users from getting in!

> This **Generator** allows you to do just that! 

### Generate a Random Password that has all or some of the following criteria:

* Your Password **MUST** be between 8 to 128 Characters

* Your Password **MAY** include Uppercase Alphabets

* Your Password **MAY** include Lowercase Alphabets

* Your Password **MAY** include Special Characters

* Your Password **MAY** include Numbers
